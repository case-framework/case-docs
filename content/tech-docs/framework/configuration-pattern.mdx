# CASE Backend Configuration Pattern

### Global Configuration Pattern

All services and jobs follow a consistent configuration pattern:

1. **YAML Configuration File**: Specified via `CONFIG_FILE_PATH` environment variable
2. **Environment Variables**: Environment variables override sensitive values from the config file, if they are provided
3. **Initialization**: Services apply defaults during startup as a fallback

### Required Environment Variable (All Services/Jobs)

**`CONFIG_FILE_PATH`** - Absolute path to the YAML configuration file

**Note**: This is the only required environment variable for all services and jobs. All other variables are optional and will use values from the configuration file if not provided.

### Service Configuration

The configuration for each part of the CASE framework is explained in the corresponding README files, e.g. for the configuration of the management-api you can find it here:
`case-backend/services/management-api/README.md`.
