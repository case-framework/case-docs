This page wants to give you an overview of the standard set of components offered by the CASE Framework.
Detailed documentation for each component is available in their respective pages.

## Offered components

### Backend Services

Event-driven APIs to interact with the system.

#### Management API

Bundles the functionality needed to manage the system and its resources. Provides authentication and authorization for the admin UI and other tools.
[More information](/tech-docs/management-api/overview)

#### Participant API

A collection of APIs for implementing participant facing functionality. Includes built-in multi-factor authentication and user management and study interactions.
[More information](/tech-docs/participant-api/overview)

#### SMTP Bridge
Internal service to bridge the framework's email sending to an external SMTP server. Has a simple API to send emails. In case, the setup is using a different email provider, this service can be replaced with a custom implementation.
[More information](/tech-docs/smtp-bridge/overview)

#### SMTP Bridge Emulator
Identical API to the SMTP Bridge, but instead of sending emails through an SMTP connection, it will write them to disk at a specified location. Useful for testing or development purposes, when no SMTP server is available yet, or to avoid sending related costs/risks in load testing.

### Backend Jobs

Scheduled or one off jobs to be run on the server.

#### Study Timer

#### User Management

#### Messaging

#### Study Daily Data Export

#### DB migration

## Basic application architecture

![Basic application architecture](./images/case-typical-setup.png)


The framework can be utilized in a variety of ways depending on the use case.
The standard application setup is as follows:

1. External resources:
    - MongoDB database
    - Email server with SMTP
    - Persistent storage for files
2. Framework components:
    - Participant facing:
        - participant-api: backend component to handle participant events and data
        - participant-frontend: frontend component to handle participant interactions. In most cases, this was implemented as a Next.js application so far, but it's not a requirement.
    - Management facing:
        - management-api: backend component to handle management events and data
        - case-admin (Admin/Management UI): a web application to handle management interactions, to configure the application and its studies, or access data in the system.
    - smtp-bridge: to bridge the framework's email sending to an external SMTP server
    - Jobs run on regular intervals:
        - messaging: to handle message related tasks, such as processing message queues or generating scheduled messages
        - study-timer: to update study statistics and handle study timer events
        - user-management: to handle user management tasks, such as reminding users to verify their email address, or cleaning up unused or unverified user accounts
3. Optional components:
    - study-daily-data-export: to prepare daily data exports for researchers
    - recruitment-list application (with backend and frontend): pull participants and their data for recruitment purposes and share it with external partners
