## Basic application architecture

The framework can be utilized in a variety of ways depending on the use case.
The standard application setup is as follows:

1. External resources:
    - MongoDB database
    - Email server with SMTP
    - Persistent storage for files
2. Framework components:
    - Participant facing:
        - participant-api: backend component to handle participant events and data
        - participant-frontend: frontend component to handle participant interactions. In most cases, this was implemented as a Next.js application so far, but it's not a requirement.
    - Management facing:
        - management-api: backend component to handle management events and data
        - case-admin: a web application to handle management interactions, to configure the application and its studies, or access data in the system.
    - smtp-bridge: to bridge the framework's email sending to an external SMTP server
    - Jobs run on regular intervals:
        - messaging: to handle message related tasks, such as processing message queues or generating scheduled messages
        - study-timer: to update study statistics and handle study timer events
        - user-management: to handle user management tasks, such as reminding users to verify their email address, or cleaning up unused or unverified user accounts
3. Optional components:
    - study-daily-data-export: to prepare daily data exports for researchers
    - recruitment-list application (with backend and frontend): pull participants and their data for recruitment purposes and share it with external partners
