Use the Rules workspace to define scheduling, triggers, and handlers that drive study logic.

- **Scheduling**: Configure when surveys become available or expire.
- **Handlers**: Add custom or entry handlers to perform actions based on events.
- **Conditions**: Use variables and participant state to control behavior.
