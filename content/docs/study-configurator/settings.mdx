## Overview

The Settings workspace provides access to various configuration options for your study. Settings are organized into different categories accessible through the left sidebar.

## General

The General tab contains the core configuration settings for your study.

![Settings General](./images/settings-general.png)

### Study Status

Study status defines whether the study is visible to participants and whether data collection is active.

- **Current status**: Select from the dropdown to set the study status:
  - `active`: Study is visible and collecting data
  - `inactive`: Study is not visible to participants

### Default Study

Configure whether this study should be the default study for your instance.

- **Default Study**: When enabled, all participants will be automatically assigned to this study by default once they log in. If the study is not the default study, participants need to join the study manually.

### Display Texts

If the instance supports study selection, the display texts define how the study appears to participants when they choose which study to join.

Click **"Edit Display Texts"** to open the editor where you can configure:

- **Study Name**: A short title for the study card (e.g., "Infectieradar")
- **Study Description**: A brief description of the study shown on the study card
- **Tags**: Optional tags to categorize the study (e.g., "tekenradar")
- **Language Support**: Edit texts for each supported language using the language selector in the top right

Changes are applied by clicking the **"Apply"** button.

### File Upload

Toggle this option to configure whether participants are allowed to upload files as part of their study participation.

## Code Lists

The Code Lists tab allows you to manage available codes for the study. These can be used to validate participant data, for example when participants need to enter specific codes to join the study or access certain features.

- **Code entries**: Shows the codes with their creation date (e.g., "9.1.2026")
- **Entry count**: Indicates how many codes are shown (e.g., "Showing 2 of 2")
- **Delete option**: Each code has an X button to remove it from the list
