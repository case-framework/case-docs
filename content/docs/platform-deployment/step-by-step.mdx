# What this tutorial entails

This article guides you through an exemplary setup and configuration of a locally run CASE-based system, excluding the participant-facing UI.

We will set up:

- case-backend (the backend server)
- case-admin (the UI for study administration)
- an associated MongoDB instance (which stores the study and data)

# Step 1: Database Setup (MongoDB)

CASE is designed to work with MongoDB. For this example we will assume a locally running database.

1. [Install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/).

2. Determine a storage folder path and configure the database by creating a `mongod.conf` file:

```yaml filename="mongod.conf"
# mongod.conf

# Storage
storage:
  dbPath: /your/defined/path/mongodb_data

# Network
net:
  bindIp: 127.0.0.1
  port: 27017

# Authorization
security:
  authorization: disabled
```

3. Launch the MongoDB service using the configuration file. On macOS, this can be done through the terminal as follows:

```sh filename="launch_db.sh"
# launch_db.sh

# Launch mongod with config file as parameter.
mongod --config mongod.conf
```

Tip: You can use a database explorer tool like MongoDB Compass to manually browse the database or perform resets when necessary.

# Step 2: case-backend Setup

1. Clone the **case-backend** repository to a location of your choice.

2. Locate the **test** folder within your copy of **case-backend**.

Within this folder, you will place configuration files for the different sub-modules of your backend service. For each backend service, create two files: a configuration YAML file and a shell script for launching the service.

3. Create a configuration file for the management-api service within the **test** folder named **management-api.yaml**.

Add all necessary variables according to the [Platform Configuration](./configuration-reference.mdx) article. When done, save the file.

4. Create a launch shell script for the management-api service within the **test** folder named **run-management-api.sh**.

Within this script, you may define the immediate environment variables, e.g. credentials for your databases. Verify that the **CONFIG_FILE_PATH** variable is correctly defined. When done, save the file and mark it as executable.

```sh filename="run-management-api.sh"
# run-management-api.sh

export CONFIG_FILE_PATH="./test/management-api.yaml"

# Management User DB
export MANAGEMENT_USER_DB_USERNAME="admin"
export MANAGEMENT_USER_DB_PASSWORD="pw"

# Participant User DB
export PARTICIPANT_USER_DB_USERNAME="admin"
export PARTICIPANT_USER_DB_PASSWORD="pw"

# Globalinfos DB
export GLOBAL_INFOS_DB_USERNAME="admin"
export GLOBAL_INFOS_DB_PASSWORD="pw"

# Messaging DB
export MESSAGING_DB_USERNAME="admin"
export MESSAGING_DB_PASSWORD="pw"

# Study DB
export STUDY_DB_USERNAME="admin"
export STUDY_DB_PASSWORD="pw"

go run services/management-api/*.go
```

5. For production deployments, you would also need to create both a **participant-api.yaml** and a **run-participant-api.sh** following the same process as the management-api service.

6. You can now run the configured services in separate terminal sessions. For example, run **run-management-api.sh** in one terminal and **run-participant-api.sh** in another simultaneously.

When called, the services should continue running and only exit when manually stopped. If a process exits immediately, an error occurred and needs to be addressed.
