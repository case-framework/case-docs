# What is the CASE Framework?

CASE is an event-driven, context-aware study system for participatory research. It consists of multiple repositories and services that form a unified software system.

## Features

CASE provides:

- Administrative UI including features like a Survey Editor, Study Configurator, Participant Management, Data Explorer, ...
- Rendering & logic for questionnaires (embedded within an existing frontend) through the Study Engine
- Definition of automated actions within studies
- Creating, editing & simulation of questionnaires
- Necessary preconfigured database models & database interactions
- Data exporting
- Access restriction (who can access / edit what)
- Messaging features (template-based email, sent through SMTP Client or SMS service)
- User management for participants
- Logging of activities

## Not Included

CASE does not provide:

- Participant-facing UI for your study
- Data Analysis
- Database

# Repositories & Components

CASE consists of several repositories. Not all may be relevant to your specific project. Below are the purposes of the main repositories and components:

- **case-backend**

  - Hosts a Go server application that interacts with an external MongoDB database. Serves as the backend for both participant-facing and administrative UIs. Handles data management, executes study logic, schedules automated tasks, manages access control, and sends messages. External software interacts with case-backend through API calls, as no UI is provided by default.

- **case-admin**

  - Provides the administrative UI for setting up studies, surveys, messaging, previewing submitted data, and managing access control. Allows study administrators to configure studies served by case-backend. Includes UI-based editors for surveys, rules, and automated actions.
  - Contains necessary components for survey rendering via `/components/survey-renderer`.

- **survey-engine**

  - Defines and handles the evaluation procedures for logic contained within studies and surveys.
  - Designed to be imported where needed.

- **survey-renderer**

  - Renders React-based questionnaire UIs based on provided context (survey definition, user and device context). Handles survey UI state changes.

- **case-editor-tools**
  - JavaScript tools to simplify survey and study coding for CASE.
  - Designed to be imported as needed.
  - Typically not required for new deployments, as most survey editing is done through the UI provided by case-admin.
