## Delete an app role template

You can delete app roles individually or all at once for an **"app name"**. Use the corresponding buttons and confirm the deletion in the popup.

When deleting app roles for an **"app name"**, this will also remove the added app roles from all management users that have this app role (not the permissions though).

> Note: Deleting templates does not revoke permissions previously granted via those roles. Review and clean up permissions as needed.
