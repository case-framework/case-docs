description: What are app roles and how to use them

## Terminology

* **App Role Template**: Admin users can create app role templates which will be used to assign app roles to the `management users`.
A template contains three parts:
  - `app name`: The name of the application in which the app role is used. It can be something generic if you are creating a template to be used as permission list template - e.g. "study-manager-app" or "admin-ui", or something specific if the app name is required - e.g. "study-nurse-portal".
  - `role`: The role the user will have in the application. One user can have multiple roles for the same app.
  - `required permissions`: The permissions required for a user with this role to use the application via the API for the intended purpose. The core systemâ€™s Management API uses permissions to authorize actions on resources.


* **App role**: Management users can get app roles assigned by admin users, defined by the `app name` and `role`. These app roles can be used by specialized extra applications/tools to authorize access to certain modules or actions.



### Use cases for app roles

- Access control for extra applications/tools and their feature modules: For example, the study has an extra application called "study-nurse-portal" with modules for data managers or nurses; you can use app roles to authorize access to these modules. While both groups may have similar permissions, their module access can differ.

- Use as a permission-list template: Within the base application, certain user groups commonly require a standard set of permissions. App role templates let admins add these permissions to a user without manually selecting each one.
