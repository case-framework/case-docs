This page describes how to assign app roles to management users.
The functionality is available only for admin users in the "User Management" module. After logging in, go to the **"User Management"** module and use the **"Management Users"** tab. Select the user you want to assign the app role to.

## Remove an app role from a management user
Click the trash icon next to the role to remove it from the user. Removing a role does not remove its permissions; you must remove permissions separately.

> Note: To avoid leaving residual privileges, review and remove any permissions that are no longer needed after removing an app role.

## Notes

### Permissions that do not belong to a role

The permissions list shows to which roles a permission is needed. This helps you determine if a permission is still needed after removing a role.

If the user has any permissions that do not belong to a role, you can remove them by clicking the `Remove Permissions without App Role` button on the bottom right side of the permissions list. This button will open a dialog to confirm the removal.

After clicking the `Remove` button, the permissions will be removed from the user.

### Missing permissions for a role

In the `App Roles` section, a warning icon appears if the user is missing a required permission for a role. Click the icon to see the list of missing permissions.
A practical fix is to remove the app role and assign it again.
