This page describes how to assign app roles to management users.
The functionality is available only for admin users in the "User Management" module. After logging in, go to the **"User Management"** module and use the **"Management Users"** tab. Select the user you want to assign the app role to.

## Remove an app role from a management user
Click the trash icon next to the role to remove it from the user. Removing a role does not remove its permissions; you must remove permissions separately.

> Note: To avoid leaving residual privileges, review and remove any permissions that are no longer needed after removing an app role.
