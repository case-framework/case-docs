</Step>


</Steps>

## Delete an app role template

You can delete app roles individually or all at once for an "app name". Use the corresponding buttons and confirm the deletion in the popup.

When deleting app roles for an "app name", this will also remove the added app roles from all management users that have this app role (not the permissions though).

> Note: Deleting templates does not revoke permissions previously granted via those roles. Review and clean up permissions as needed.
