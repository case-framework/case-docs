### User Information

The User Details section displays:

- **Profile icon and name**: The user's avatar and full name
- **Email address**: The registered email address
- **Created at**: Timestamp when the user account was created
- **Last login at**: Timestamp of the user's most recent login
- **sub from IdP**: The unique subject identifier received from the Identity Provider 
- **User ID**: The unique internal identifier for this user in the application

### Managing App Roles

You can assign app roles to this user to grant them specific sets of permissions. For detailed instructions, see [Assigning Roles](/docs/user-management/management-users/assigning-roles).

### Managing Permissions

Permissions define which actions the user is allowed to perform in the system. If no permissions are configured, you'll see the message "This user has no permissions."

#### Adding Permissions

Click the `+ Add Permission` button to grant the user access to specific actions or resources.

In the permission dialog, you can configure:

<Steps>
<Step>
**Resource Type**: Select the type of resource. Options are: `Study`, `Messaging`, or `Participant Users`.
</Step>

<Step>
**Resource Key**: Specify the resource identifier depending on the resource type:
   - For **Study**: Enter a study key (e.g., "tekenradar") or use "*" for all studies
   - For **Messaging**: Select a resource ID from: `global-email-templates`, `study-email-templates`, `scheduled-emails`, or `sms-templates`
   - For **Participant Users**: Only `*` is available (applies to all participant users)
</Step>
<Step>
**Action**: Select the action the user is allowed to perform (e.g., "get-reports")
</Step>
<Step>
**Limiter** (available for specific actions): Define additional constraints in JSON format. For example, to limit access to specific reports, use the format `[{"reportKey": "report1"}]`
</Step>
</Steps>

After configuring the permission, click **"Add Permission"** to grant it to the user.

<Callout type="warning">
Review permissions regularly and remove any that are no longer needed to maintain security.
</Callout>

## Delete User

If a management user account is no longer needed, you can permanently delete it from the system.

To access the delete option, scroll down to the bottom of the page.

<Callout type="warning">
Deleting a user will remove all their permissions and sessions from the system.

To actually revoke full access to the system, you need to remove access through the Identity Provider.
</Callout>

Click the red **"Delete User"** button to permanently remove the user account. This action cannot be undone.
