## Terminology

* **App Role Template**: Admin users can create app role templates which will be used to assign app roles to the `management users`.
A template contains three parts:
  - `app name`: The name of the application in which the app role is used. It can be something generic if you are creating a template to be used as permission list template - e.g. "study-manager-app" or "admin-ui", or something specific if the app name is required - e.g. "study-nurse-portal".
  - `role`: The role the user will have in the application. One user can have multiple roles for the same app.
  - `required permissions`: The permissions that are required for a user with this role to have for using the application through the API for the intended purpose. The management-api of the core system is using permissions to authorize users to perform actions on the resources.


* **App role**: Management users can get app roles assigned by admin users, defined by the `app name` and `role`. These app roles can be used by specialized extra applications/tools to authorize access to certain modules or actions.



### Use cases for app roles

- Access control for extra applications/tools and their feature modules: For example, the study has an extra application called "study-nurse-portal" which has modules for "data-managers" or "nurses", we can use app roles to authorize access to these modules. While both user groups might have the same or highly overlapping permissions, they might need to have different access to the modules.

- Using as a permission list template: within the base application, often there is a set of permissions certain user groups should have. By creating an app role template, admins can simplify adding these permissions to a user, without having to manually assign each permission.
