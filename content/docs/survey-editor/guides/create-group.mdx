### What are Item Groups?

An **item group** is a collection of questions or information items that are treated as a unit within the survey. Grouping can be used for:

- **Randomization within a group**: Shuffle the order of items inside a group without affecting the global order.
- **Semantic separation**: Keep logically related items together (e.g., demographics, preferences, follow-up questions).
- **Conditional logic**: Show or hide entire groups based on earlier answers (e.g., show a group only if the user selected "Yes" to a previous question).
- **Referencing groups by key**: Groups can be addressed via a unique key, making logic and condition rules easier to manage and maintain.

<Files>
  <Folder name="Group 1" defaultOpen>
    <File name="Single Choice Question" icon={<CircleCheck />} />
    <File name="Multiple Choice Question" icon={<SquareCheck />} />
    <File name="Time Input Question" icon={<Clock />} />
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="Group 2" defaultOpen>
    <File name="Consent Question" icon={<MessageCircleQuestionMark />}/>
    <File name="Contact Form Question" icon={<Contact />}/>
  </Folder>
</Files>

This example above shows a typical item group structure: Group 1 includes standard question types such as e.g. single choice.
The order of the items in Group 1 can be randomized independently of other items in the survey.
Group 2 collects sensitive inputs, like consent and contact form questions, which should be in fixed order.
By grouping related items, the survey becomes more structured, easier to manage, and flexible for applying randomized order or visibility rules.

### How to set up a simple group

To create a group in the **Survey Editor**:

<Steps>
<Step>
Click the **"Add a new item"** button (plus icon in the left toolbar).
</Step>
<Step>
In the menu, select **"Group"**.  
</Step>
<Step>
A new empty group will be added to your item list. Change the key by clicking on the current group key in the top navigation bar and entering a new key.
You can also add an item label in the middle of the top navigation bar for easier identification.
</Step>
<Step>
Create new items inside the group by clicking on **"Create new item"**.
</Step>
<Step>
You can also add existing items to the group: Select the item, click the three-dot menu in the top-right corner, and choose **“Move to other group”**.
A popup will open with a dropdown menu, allowing you to select the key of the target group you want the item to be moved into.
