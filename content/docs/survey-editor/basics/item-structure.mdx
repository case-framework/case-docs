## Survey Items

A survey consists of items. An item can belong to either a question type or a non-question type category. (Read more about [item types](/docs/survey-editor/basics/item-structure#item-types)).

 A question item is structured by the following **components**:

#### **Header**
Item header elements consist of:
- **Title (`H1`)** – Main question or prompt.
- **Subtitle (`H2`)** – Additional explanation or secondary text.
- **Help/Info popup** – Optional tooltip for additional guidance.

#### **Body**
Main content that surrounds the response options:
- **Top content (before response)** – Text shown above the answer options.
- **Response options** – Here you define the response options. The type of question determines the available response configurations.
- **Bottom content (after response)** – Text shown after answer options.

#### **Footnote**
- Additional information displayed at the bottom of the item.

### Other Item Types in a Survey

Besides question items, a survey can contain several non-question structural or informational items. These help organize and enrich the flow and content of the survey.

**Page Break**
- **Separates content into different pages.**
- Improves readability and controls how questions are grouped.

**Response Group**
- **Groups multiple question items together.**
- Useful for displaying several related questions under a shared heading or context.

**Info Item**
- **Displays additional information without asking for input.**
- Can include text instructions, explanations, or visual content and supports the respondent with guidance or context before a question or section.

**End of Survey Content**
- **Marks the end of the survey flow.**
- Typically includes logic to stop collecting further responses and displays a closing message, thank-you note, or redirect.
