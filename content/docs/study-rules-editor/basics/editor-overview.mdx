## Study Rules Editor

The **Study Rules Editor** allows you to define rules that are applied to participants during different stages of a study.  
Rules are executed when specific **events** are triggered (e.g., when a participant enters or leaves the study, or when a survey is submitted).  
This makes it possible to automate study workflows and participant management.

### General

- **Session name**  
  You can give the current session a name to help identify it later.  
  Example: `Pilot Study Session`  

- **Context**  
  The editor context provides access to survey and message keys, participant flags, reports and external event handlers that can be referenced in your rules.  
  You can import a context from a previous session or from a file or create a new one via the **Open context editor** button.

### Event Handlers

Event handlers define what should happen when a certain event occurs in the study.  
Each handler can contain one or more rules that are applied in sequence.

#### 1. Entry event handler
Rules defined here are applied **when a participant enters the study**.  
Typical use cases:
- Sending a welcome message
- Assigning an intake survey to collect initial data
- Schedule reminder message for intake survey

---

#### 2. Merge event handler
Rules defined here are applied **when a temporary participant is merged into an active participant account**.  
Typical use cases:
- Consolidating data between accounts
- Transferring survey progress
- Keeping participant metadata consistent

---

#### 3. Leave event handler
Rules defined here are applied **when a participant leaves the study** (e.g., when their account is deleted or deactivated).  
Typical use cases:
- Marking the participant as inactive
- Revoking access to study materials
- Sending a goodbye message

---

#### 4. Survey submission handlers
Rules defined here are applied **when a participant submits a survey**.  
You can define multiple handlers (one for each survey or condition).  
Typical use cases:
- Delete assignment to the survey and trigger new assignments for follow up
- Send data to external services to evaluate survey answers
- Updating participant flags based on responses
- Sending notifications to researchers
- Create reports
- Remove scheduled reminder messages and create new ones for follow-up surveys.

### Options Menu

In the top-right corner, the **Options** menu provides additional settings to manage the session and export/import rule definitions.


#### Rules in the Study Context  

**Definition:**  
Rules are automated actions that are triggered when certain conditions on participant data are met. They allow you to define *if–then* logic within your study so that specific operations are executed dynamically.  

**How they work:**  
- A rule consists of two parts:  
  1. **Conditional expression** – this is the *if* part. It evaluates participant data (e.g., survey responses, flags, or context variables).  
  2. **Action** – this is the *then* part. If the condition is true, the action is executed.  

**Example:**  
- *Condition:* The participant’s age is less than 18.  
- *Action:* Assign the participant to the *minor* study group.  

**Purpose:**  
Rules help automate study workflows by:  
- Enforcing logic across surveys.  
- Classifying or segmenting participants.  
- Triggering follow-up tasks or notifications.  
- Ensuring data consistency and validity.
