## Study Rules Editor

The **Study Rules Editor** allows you to define rules that are applied to participants during different stages of a study.
Rules are executed when specific **events** are triggered (e.g., when a participant enters or leaves the study, or when a survey is submitted).
This makes it possible to automate study workflows and participant management.

- **Context**  
  The editor context provides access to survey and message keys, participant flags, reports and external event handlers that can be referenced in your rules.

### Event Handlers

Event handlers define what should happen when a certain event occurs in the study.  
Each handler can contain one or more rules that are applied in sequence.

#### 1. Entry event handler
Rules defined here are applied **when a participant enters the study**.  
Typical use cases:
- Sending a welcome message
- Assigning an intake survey to collect initial data
- Schedule reminder message for intake survey


#### 2. Merge event handler
Rules defined here are applied **when a temporary participant is merged into an active participant account**.  
Typical use cases:
- Consolidating data between accounts
- Transferring survey progress
- Keeping participant metadata consistent


#### 3. Leave event handler
Rules defined here are applied **when a participant leaves the study** (e.g., when their account is deleted or deactivated).  
Typical use cases:
- Marking the participant as inactive
- Remove confidential responses
- Revoking access to study materials
- Sending a goodbye message



#### 4. Custom Event Handler
Rules defined here are executed **when a custom event is triggered**, for example when a participant clicks a button to order a test kit.  

Typical use cases include:  
- Create reports for researcher
- Enable external event handler
- Updating participant flags


#### 5. Survey submission handlers
Rules defined here are applied **when a participant submits a survey**.  
You can define multiple handlers (one for each survey).  
Typical use cases:
- Delete assignment to the survey and trigger new assignments for follow up
- Send data to external services to evaluate survey answers
- Updating participant flags based on responses
- Sending notifications to researchers
- Create reports
- Remove scheduled reminder messages and create new ones for follow-up surveys.


#### 6. Timer Event Handler
Rules defined here are executed **when a study timer event occurs** (e.g., at scheduled intervals or specific times).  

Typical use cases include:  
- Sending periodic reminder messages  
- Scheduling follow-up surveys  
- Automatically updating participant data over time
