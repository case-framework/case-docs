## Study Rules Editor Dashboard

The **Study Rules Editor** allows you to define rules that are applied to participants during different stages of a study.
Rules are executed when specific **events** are triggered (e.g., when a participant enters or leaves the study, or when a survey is submitted).
This makes it possible to automate study workflows and participant management.


### Top Navigation Bar

- **"Project"**: Click here to open an existing project, save your project or export the study rules.
- **"Context"**: The editor context provides access to study and message keys, participant flags, reports and external event handlers that can be referenced in your rules.
You can import a context from a recent session or [create a new one](/docs/study-rules-editor/basics/editor-overview#context-editor) via the **"Open context editor"** button.


### General

- **"Session name"**: You can give the current session a name to help identify it later.

- **"Options"**: In the top-right corner, the Options menu lets you save or export your study rules as a file.

### Event Handlers

Event handlers define what should happen when a certain event occurs in the study.
Each handler can contain one or more rules that are applied in sequence.

#### 1. Entry event handler
Rules defined here are applied **when a participant enters the study**.
Typical use cases:
- Sending a welcome message
- Assigning an intake survey to collect initial data
- Schedule reminder message for intake survey

#### 2. Survey submission handlers
Rules defined here are applied **when a participant submits a survey**.
You can define multiple handlers (one for each survey).
Typical use cases:
- Delete assignment to the survey and trigger new assignments for follow-up
- Updating participant flags based on responses
- Sending notifications to researchers
- Create reports
- Remove scheduled reminder messages and create new ones for follow-up surveys.
- Send data to external services to evaluate survey answers

#### 3. Merge event handler
Rules defined here are applied **when a temporary (or virtual)participant is merged into an active participant account**.
Typical use cases:
- After completing an survey without logging in, the participant decides to create (or use an existing) account and continue with the study
- "Virtual participants" created by researcher accept invitation and sign up with their own account

#### 4. Custom Event Handler
Rules defined here are executed **when a custom event is triggered**, for example when a participant clicks a button to order a test kit. Used for small, occasional actions that don't require a survey response.
The handler typically contains methods for:
- Creating a report
- Updating participant flags
- Rescheduling surveys
- Enabling an external event handler

#### 5. Timer Event Handler
Rules defined here are executed **when a study timer event occurs** (e.g., at scheduled intervals or specific times).
Typical use cases include:
- Sending periodic reminder messages
- Scheduling follow-up surveys
- Automatically updating participant data over time


#### 6. Leave event handler
Rules defined here are applied **when a participant leaves the study** (e.g., when their account is deleted or deactivated).
Typical use cases:
- Marking the participant as deleted
- Remove confidential responses from the study database
- Sending a goodbye message
