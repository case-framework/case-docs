title: Methods of the study engine
description: Actions and expressions supported by the study engine
---

## Study engine

The study engine is the core component of the study running on the server. Its main responsibility is to handle study events based on each study's own rule set.

When a specific event occurs (e.g. a participant submits a survey), the study engine evaluates the participant's data against the study's rules and executes the appropriate actions.
These rules encode the study flow. The engine supports a large set of actions and expressions, providing a high level of freedom in the study design.

**Actions:** typically used to mutate the participant's state, e.g. assign a survey, send a message, create a report, etc.

**Expressions:** typically used to evaluate the participant's state, e.g. check if the participant has a specific flag, check if the participant has answered a specific question, etc.

**Example of a conditional rule:**
- *Condition:* Participant's age is less than 18. -> expression comparing a numeric value against a threshold
- *Action:* Set the participant's age category to *child*. -> action setting a participant flag


## Expressions

### Logical Operators

Logical conditions allow you to combine multiple expressions into more complex rules.
They include **AND, OR, and NOT**, which determine whether all, any, or none of the specified conditions must be true.
**Example:** assign a test kit only if the participant has clicked the Order button **AND** has given consent.

### Comparisons

Comparison conditions check whether a value associated with the participant (e.g., responses, context variables, participant flags, or dates) matches or differs from another value.
The value on the right side can either be a fixed input or another participant associated value.
They include **equals, less than, less than or equal, greater than, and greater than or equal**.
Use these when you want rules to trigger only if study data falls inside or outside specific thresholds.
**Example:** Assign a follow-up survey only if the participant’s age flag is greater than or equal to 18.


### Event Properties

#### 3. **Get timestamp for next occurrence of a start of month**  
* **Meaning:** Returns the timestamp for the next start of a specified month.  
* **Use Case:** Ideal for monthly scheduling, e.g., sending out surveys at the beginning of each month.
